# Role Assignments

You can assign users to roles in one of three ways:

1. Select a user and manage that person's role assignments.
2. Select a role and add/remove users for that role.
3. Select multiple users, then add/remove them from multiple roles at once.

Here are the instructions for each method:

## Manage one user's roles

From the users list, click on the "Roles" button for the user you want
to manage.  On that form you can delete or add roles for that person.
When done click "Save."

## Manage users for one role

## Add/Remove multiple users from multiple roles

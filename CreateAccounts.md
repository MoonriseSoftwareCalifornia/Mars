# Creating New Users

User accounts can be created in one of three ways:

1. Users "self register" using the "Register" link on the website; and,
2. Administrators create one user at a time
3. Administrators create multiple users at a using the "Users" list.

## User Self Registration

"Self registration" is when users create accounts on their own by clicking on the "registration" link.  This is the default method with ASP.NET Identity.

## Create one account at a time

This method allows administrator's to create user accounts on behalf
of users and set their password for them.

To get started, click on the "Create Single User" button on the Users list.

Enter information about the user. Either allow a password to be automatically generated, or, choose to create a password for them.

If you check "Email confirmed" the user will not be sent an Email validation message.

Click "Register User."

The next screen will display the account's new password (one time only). As an administrator you can send this password to a user.

It is recommended that you send the password via telephone or text message,
NOT by email.

## Creating Users in Batches

Create multiple users at a time by opening the Mars "Users" list. This method
requires users to create their own password.

Click on the "Add" button to add a line, then add the new user's email
address and optionally their phone number.

After all the users have been saved, click the "Save Changes" button.

Each user will be sent an email requesting that they create a new password.

# Role Management

From the users list click on the "Role Management" button.  This will take you
to the role list page.

From here you can create one or more roles at a time, change their name, and delete them.

Click on the "Users" button for each role to manage users within each role.

## Batch Add/Remove Users Role Assignments

You can add or remove multiple users to and from multiple roles by starting
with the Users list (the home page).

Next, select all the users you want to add or remove from one or more roles.

Note that as you select users a new button will appear called "Add/Remove Users from Roles."  Once you are done selecting users click that button.

Now select the roles you want to target.  Notice that as you do you have
two new buttons appear: "Add Selected Users to Roles" and "Remove Selected Users from Roles."

Once you have finished selecting the roles click either of the buttons above
to perform the desired task.
